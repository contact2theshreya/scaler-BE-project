## To create a key pair using Amazon EC2(if not already created)
Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

In the navigation pane, under Network & Security, choose Key Pairs.

Choose Create key pair.

For Name, enter a descriptive name for the key pair. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It canâ€™t include leading or trailing spaces.

Select a key pair type appropriate for your operating system:

(Linux instances) For Key pair type, choose either RSA or ED25519.

(Windows instances) For Key pair type, choose RSA. ED25519 keys are not supported for Windows instances.

For Private key file format, choose the format in which to save the private key. To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, choose pem. To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, choose ppk.

To add a tag to the public key, choose Add tag, and enter the key and value for the tag. Repeat for each tag.

Choose Create key pair.
