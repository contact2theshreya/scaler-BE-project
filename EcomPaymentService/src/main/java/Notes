PaymentGateway fee -> 2%

Razorpay wants-> 1.5%
Stripe wants-> 1.8%

Out of 10 transactions, 7 should go with Razorpay, 3 should go with Stripe

Math.random() -> 1 to 10
if(n <=7 ) {
razorpay
} else {
stripe
}

Math.random(1 to 100) -> mathematically -> generate 100 numbers, ideally
it should generate 1 to 100 but there might be case that a number can repaet
so generate bigger  no of times for bbetter distribution
Math.random ( 1 to 10) -> 10k times, each number should be generated 1k times

10k ->
1 -> 1k times
2 -> 1k times
3 -> 1k times

1-7 -> 7k
8-10 -> 3k
